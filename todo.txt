Check extension in Config.cpp
Write a config ==overload to check if ocnfig is already in there, before _addConfig is called.

Figure out how to do the errorHandling.

(?) Should I add a response_code var to struct? [Just did, just in case.]

After _setNonblocking need to add more error handling. What needs to happen here?
